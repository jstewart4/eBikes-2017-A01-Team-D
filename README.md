# Intermediate Application Development

This final project was given to the students to work as a group and apply what we had learned in the Intermediate Application Development course at NAIT. The main objective was to create an Intranet web application using ASP.NET Web Forms to allow employees to manage various aspects of a business. 

For the project I was responsible for allowing the business to purchase items for their inventory (Purchasing pages). The project team implemented the necessary parts of the solution with tools and techniques such as Entity Framework, ADO.NET, LINQ queries, transactional processing, user controls, and UX design.
